#My Perfect Pet

My Perfect Pet is a site that helps connect people with pets that match their personalities. First the user can take a survey, to see what type of pet would be good based on their personality and lifestyle. The survey may or may not be scientific *wink wink*. Users can also create a profile for their pet.

In addition to the survey and pet profile, users can do a pet search based on location, breed, etc. for pets in animal shelters across the country.

The requirements for this project were:
* Use a Node and Express Web Server;
